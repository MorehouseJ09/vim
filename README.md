Vim Configuration
=================

This vim configuration lives at $HOME/.vim and is what I use as my daily development editor.

Getting Started
---------------

```
# clone repository as well as vundle submodule
git clone --recursive git@github.com:jonmorehouse/vim $HOME/.vim

# install all vundle dependencies
vim +PluginInstall +qall

```
